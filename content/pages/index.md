Regarding online chat, a brief lucky period of history was
dominated by a few simple and 
reliable, extensible and open protocols,
such as well-known IRC and XMPP. 👽
Designed by computer scientists and subject to peer review
via RFCs,
available for good use by anyone.
There were the protocols,
and there was a multitude of software clients,
each of which could speak the protocol,
but could do so in a customized and user-centric
and tunable manner. 👌

*[IRC]: Internet Relay Chat
*[XMPP]: Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol
*[RFCs]: Request For Comments
*[protocol]: a set of rules governing the exchange or transmission of data between devices

Then along with the web platform came corporations
and startups and vendors,
and they, one by one, switched to 
secret and proprietary 👁 chat
protocols and non-interoperable clients,
locking their consumer users forever more in. 
And today you can't influence the 
sort order of your online friends in an app like Facebook. 😠

**Easily [extensible]({filename}/pages/faq.md#extending)
(Python, Qt) 🐍
with custom tabs** for custom actions and launchers.

**EFCK is known to work with most
desktop applications**, namely:
web browsers and, within them, web apps like 
Gmail, Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp,
Slack, GitHub, Discord, YouTube, Tinder ...;
standalone Electron-based desktop clients like 
Telegram, Discord, MS Teams, Jitsi, Zoom,
Skype, mIRC ...; file managers, many text editors,
dialog-based desktop services, **and really just any
desktop widget that maintains input field keyboard focus**,
or, in case of GIFs, supports file drop actions.

**Stop wasting literal ages waiting** for the lazy 
web app of the day's
emoji/sticker picker to load.  
--- Show emotion!
Take back control. Join the resistance! ✊
