Keyboard-driven emoji picker
----------------------------
<div class="p" markdown="1">
<div markdown="1">
All the latest emojis! 🤩
We've got more emojis than the competition.
See for yourself.
**Over 3600+ emojis from Unicode 15**,
and EFCK Chat Keyboard has got them all,
styled to your preference,
and with
automatic resolution of name aliases including
common shortcodes and custom strings.

Upon acivation, your chosen emoji is simply
**pasted in the previously-focused window**.
In case this is unsupported on your
platform, the emoji is placed into **system clipboard** 📋
for your immediate use.

<div markdown="1">
Bring focus and attention to what's important with
**bold _emphasis_**,
<span aria-label="underlines">u̲n̲d̲e̲r̲l̲i̲n̲e̲s̲</span> or
<span aria-label="some squares">🆂🄾🄼🄴 🆂🅀🅄🄰🅁🄴🅂</span>,
<span aria-label="write a letter in handwriting">𝔀𝓻𝓲𝓽𝓮 𝓪 𝓵𝓮𝓽𝓽𝓮𝓻 𝓲𝓷 𝓱𝓪𝓷𝓭𝔀𝓻𝓲𝓽𝓲𝓷𝓰</span>,
<span aria-label="leetspeak to prune the noobs">l3375p34k 70 prun3 73h n0085</span>,
<span aria-label="monospace the code">𝚖𝚘𝚗𝚘𝚜𝚙𝚊𝚌𝚎 𝚝𝚑𝚎 𝚌𝚘𝚍𝚎</span>
<span aria-label="upside down">uʍop ǝpᴉsdn</span>,
<s>strikehrough the changed facts</s>
<span aria-label="in all kinds of ways"≯i̸n̸ ̸a̸l̸l̸ ̸k̸i̸n̸d̸s̸ ̸o̸f̸ ̸w̸a̸y̸s</span>
or add a touch of
<span aria-label="Gothic">𝕲𝖔𝖙𝖍𝖎𝖈</span>
or
<span aria-label="Zalgo">Z̛̳͐̏a̳ͭl̲̹͇ͧ̌͠ģ̗̗ŏ̭͉̩</span>
for a particular effect.

Custom transforms can be scripted in 
**literally single lines of Python code**. 🤏

This works in all kinds of apps and all kinds
of post/text fields that are nowadays otherwise
no-markup, plain-text only.
Online marketer's and influencer's edge
if you know it.

Extensible, KISS* design

design, it manages to stay inclusive of
every known gender, skin color and hair style.
Set your prefs and fire away! 🌈🦄❄

The program is extensible in all possible terms, but particularly
in terms of **custom filters and hook-in custom tabs**. See the relevant
[FAQ entries]({filename}/pages/faq.md#extending)
